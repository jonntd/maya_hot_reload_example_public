This is neither a new idea, nor is it in any way revolutionary. I was first
introduced to this concept of hot-reloadable C/C++ by 
[Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero series](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day021), 
but had held off on trying to implement the same workflow in Maya until
now. There are other resources on this topic, such as 
[Molecular Matter's engine](https://blog.molecular-matters.com/2014/05/10/using-runtime-compiled-c-code-as-a-scripting-language-under-the-hood/), 
[Doug Binks/Matthew Jack's Runtime Compiled C/C++](http://runtimecompiledcplusplus.blogspot.com/), 
and 
[Danny Angelo Carminati Grein's ``cr.h`` header](https://fungos.github.io/blog/2017/11/20/cr.h-a-simple-c-hot-reload-header-only-library/#the-problem),
all of which I referenced heavily while taking a look at this topic and
implementing a similar approach.

**Siew Yi Liang**: I wrote this overly-long wall of text and the example code
here. You can find more of my ramblings [here](http://www.sonictk.com/blog).
